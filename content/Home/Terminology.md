# Terminology

We need strict definitions of the software terms: bug, weakness, and vulnerability; as well as of the term security failure.

- Software bug:

We define a *software bug* as a coding error that needs to be fixed.

- Software Weakness:

Although it is difficult to define a *software weakness* itself, we know that it is caused by a bug or ill-formed data. A *weakness type* is also a meaningful notion, as different vulnerabilities may have the same type of underlying weaknesses.

- Software Vulnerability:

We define a *software vulnerability* as an instance of a weakness type that leads to a security failure. It may have more than one underlying weaknesses linked by causality.

- Security Failure:

We define a *security failure* as a violation of a system security requirement.
